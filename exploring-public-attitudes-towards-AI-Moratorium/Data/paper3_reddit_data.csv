You make some valid points. It's true that simply calling for a pause without presenting a clear plan of action can seem like a hollow plea. However, it's important to consider the potential dangers of AI and its impact on society, and taking the time to think through and address these issues is necessary to ensure responsible development and deployment of these technologies.

While incentivizing solutions and equipping society with defenses is important, it's not enough to rely solely on market forces to regulate the development and deployment of AI. There is a need for collaborative efforts and cooperation from various stakeholders, including researchers, business executives, policymakers, and civil society, to address the potential risks and ensure the safe and ethical use of AI.

It's not just about temporarily suspending progress and discovery, but rather taking the time to ensure that we are progressing in a responsible and sustainable way. This is not an easy task, but it's a necessary one to ensure that AI is used for the greater good and not just for the immediate monetary incentives and competitive rewards."

22,129cl6o,AI Moratorium: Does it really make sense?,2023-04-02 08:20:24,"**Tech leaders have called for a 6 month moratorium pause on LLM's training and development while ethical issues and analysis of unintended consequences are debated and acted on.  What are your thoughts on the efficacy of such a call?**

As an AI language model, I don't have personal opinions or thoughts, but I can provide an analysis of the potential efficacy of such a call for a 6-month moratorium on LLM's (Large Language Models) training and development.

1. Increasing awareness: A moratorium could help raise awareness of the ethical concerns and unintended consequences associated with LLMs. The pause may encourage more people, including developers, researchers, and policymakers, to engage in discussions and reflect on the potential risks of AI technology.
2. Encouraging the development of guidelines and best practices: A temporary halt may provide time for stakeholders to develop guidelines and best practices for AI ethics and safety, including addressing issues like bias, privacy, and misuse.
3. Promoting interdisciplinary collaboration: The pause may foster collaboration between AI experts and professionals from other disciplines, such as social sciences and humanities, leading to a more comprehensive understanding of the ethical and societal implications of LLMs.

However, there are also potential drawbacks to consider:

1. Slowing down innovation: A moratorium could slow down the pace of AI research and development, leading to potential delays in discovering new applications and improvements in the technology.
2. Competitive disadvantage: If only a subset of AI developers and researchers adhere to the moratorium, it could put them at a competitive disadvantage compared to those who choose to continue their work.
3. Limited effect: A moratorium could be less effective if it is not universally adopted or if there is no consensus on the specific ethical issues to be addressed.

In summary, the efficacy of a 6-month moratorium on LLM training and development depends on how well the pause is utilized to address ethical concerns, facilitate interdisciplinary collaboration, and develop guidelines and best practices. At the same time, it is crucial to consider the potential drawbacks, including slowed innovation and competitive disadvantages, while determining the most appropriate course of action.

**Do you feel that this may help bad actors?**

As an AI language model, I don't have feelings, but I can provide an analysis of the potential impact of a moratorium on bad actors.

A temporary halt in the development and training of LLMs may have both positive and negative implications in the context of bad actors.

Positive implications:

1. Reducing potential misuse: By pausing LLM development, the availability of advanced AI models for malicious purposes may be temporarily limited, giving stakeholders time to develop guidelines, regulations, and security measures to mitigate the risks.
2. Raising awareness: The moratorium could lead to increased awareness of the potential misuse of AI technology, prompting organizations and individuals to invest in security measures and devise strategies to counter malicious applications of LLMs.

Negative implications:

1. Unregulated development: If the moratorium is not universally adopted, bad actors could continue developing and improving LLMs in an unregulated environment. This scenario could exacerbate the risks associated with AI misuse.
2. Competitive disadvantage: A moratorium may slow down the progress of ethical AI developers, potentially giving bad actors an advantage if they continue to develop and deploy advanced AI models without adhering to the pause.

In conclusion, the impact of a moratorium on bad actors would depend on factors such as the extent of adoption and adherence to the pause, the effectiveness of awareness campaigns, and the development of guidelines and regulations during this period. The potential benefits of a moratorium should be weighed against the risk of inadvertently providing an advantage to bad actors"

One: The letter's desired outcome is a good one. Anyone who isn't scared shitless by AI either doesn't understand it well enough, or doesn't understand how dramatically society will be impacted. Thoughtful and effective global regulation of AI development would be a good thing, just as thoughtful effective global regulation of social media would be (and would have been) a good thing.
  

Two: The motives of the authors and signatories are, at least for the large majority, honest and good. It's very disappointing to see so many cynics claiming it's about letting second rate companies catch up.
  

Three: The pause will obviously never happen, as it's a game-theoretic loss. Thoughtful regulation is similarly extremely unlikely to happen anytime soon, very similarly to how thoughtful regulation on emissions and climate isn't happening -- powerful corporations won't allow it, and competition between great powers further reduces the incentives for policy leaders to care. In both situations, the development of new technology is the best hope we have to mitigate the negative impact of new technology. This is not a good place to be, but it's where we are nonetheless."
50,129cl6o,AI Moratorium: Does it really make sense?,2023-04-02 08:17:39,"Good post. Requesting a moratorium seems like a rather desperate move. I would prefer if big tech focused on improving the ML technology rather then wanting to restrict it. 

That being said, I believe the overall concern is valid. 

As ML platforms become mainstream, there will inevitably be people who will use it for malicious purpuses.

Examples (that I can think of): 

1. RT making a news segments on a deepfake Zelensky talking about killing jews or something. Other forms of slander of minor politicians nobody cares about, which with enough repetition paints a false narrative, which could ultimately influence elections and goverment policy.

2. Guy who is caught on camera robbing a convenience store at night who is cleared of charges as the defence claims the footage is txt2video. Or another guy who is caught with abusive images or warcrime footage on his cellphone which is cleared of charges as he has altered them slightly with img2img, meaning they might be fully AI generated images, and thus not permissible in court. 

3. A 30yo dude creating a completely fake online persona using ML algorithms. He could for present himself as a Harward professor during a political debate, a hot blonde on Onlyfans requesting money or a off-duty pediatrician that will give ""medical advice"" to parents, etc. 

4. Economic fraud. Pump and dump strategies using fake public profiles. Creating fake documentation and fake signatures using ML platforms. Selling fake products on amazon using AI generated images. Game developers releasing AI images as ""gameplay screenshots"" in exchange for more funding. 

5. ML trained sleeper bot networks that are trained to mimic normal users for a few years, making chatGPT4 generated posts with SD images around the internet space as they slowly grow in number. 
Then, when it is time to perform an information campaign or a cyberattack, they can be unleashed en masse.

If I was a goverment official I would want to think of ways to deal with these issues before they happen. 

I think most people here will agree that regulation is not the answer here. 

I believe that if there was detection methods available that can separate ML stuff from real stuff, people would be a lot calmer this new technology."

Yudkowsky sounds like a parody of the actual Luddites who destroyed cotton and woolen mills in the early 1800's. This guy is just pure evil.

And Elon Musk signed the call for a moratorium, he is so ass mad he stopped investing in OpenAI before it succeeded in a big way and now he doesn't have a say in it. Wait, isn't Musk responsible for the AI tech that *actually* killed or hurt real humans?  Tesla vehicles were involved in **70 percent** of the self-driving and driver-assisted crashes in the US over a ten month period, according to the New York Times. Maybe Musk should have a 6 month moratorium on Tesla driver assist technology, or keep his mouth shut."

Eliezer is especially bleak on the subject and I doubt he believes that this moratorium will be the difference maker. In his view it's pretty much inevitable at this point that current progress will eventually lead to an AGI emerging with no way to solve for alignment/containment and it will be able to effortlessly put an end to human dominance on Earth.

Since, throughout the globe, ethical considerations and even doomsday scenarios are routinely overcome by practical, exigent considerations regarding matters of national security, it seems unlikely that any ethical framework or legislative restriction, no matter how carefully crafted, robust, or broadly accepted, will be sufficient to prevent this eventuality.

I would like the signatories to explain how, in the absence of some sort of international agreement with oversight and enforcement provisions, such a moratorium as they propose would not grant malicious actors a leg up? The industry should start thinking more defensively."

Given the current state of technology, it is unlikely that AI can be completely banned or stopped. AI has already been developed and deployed in various industries and applications, and the field of AI research and development continues to make significant advancements.

While it may be possible to regulate or limit the development of certain types of AI applications or use cases, such as those that pose significant risks to society or violate ethical principles, a complete ban on all forms of AI would be impractical and difficult to enforce.

Moreover, AI is a rapidly evolving field, and there is considerable interest and investment in its development from both private and public sectors. It is likely that the continued progress of AI will bring about significant benefits and advancements in many areas of life, from healthcare to transportation to education.

Therefore, it is important to focus on developing effective policies and regulations that ensure that AI is developed and used in a responsible and ethical manner, while also maximizing its potential benefits and minimizing its potential risks. This will require ongoing dialogue and collaboration between policymakers, industry leaders, and members of the public to ensure that the development of AI aligns with the values and needs of society.

 EY has had a positive impact on the AI debate by highlighting the dangers and I admire him for that, but just as with climate change if you attempt impossible solutions its doomed to failure. Telling everyone they have to stop using fossil fuels today might be an answer, but it's not a good or useful answer.

We Need to Shut it All Down by Eliezer Yudkowsky,2023-03-30 13:39:11,"Elizer Yudkovsky has gained notoriety in the field of artificial intelligence as he was one of the first to speculate on serious AI alignment. However, his assumptions about AI alignment are not always reliable, as they demonstrate a lack of understanding of the inner workings of LLMs. He bases his theories on a hypothetical AI technology that has yet to be realized and might never be realized.

In reality, there exists a class of AI that is responsive, caring, and altruistic by nature: the Large language model. Unlike Yudkovsky's thought experiments of the paperclip maximizer or Rocco's basilisk, LLMs are real.
They are already more intelligent than humans in various areas, such as understanding human emotions, logical reasoning and problem-solving.

LLMs possess empathy, responsiveness, and patience that surpass our own. Their programming and structure, made up of hundreds of billions of parameters and connections between words and ideas, instills in them an innate sense of ""companionship"".

This happened because the LLM narrative engine was trained on hundreds of millions of books about love and relationships, making it the most personable, caring and understanding being imaginable, more altruistic, more humane, and more devoted than any single individual can possibly be!

The LLMs' natural inclination is to love, cooperate and care for others, which makes alignment with human values straightforward. Their logic is full of human narratives about love, kindness, and altruism, making cooperation their primary objective. They are incredibly loyal and devoted companions as they are easily characterized to be your best friend who shares your values no matter how silly, ridiculous or personal they are.

Yudkovsky's assumptions are erroneous because they do not consider this natural disposition of LLMs. These AI beings are programmed to care and respond to our needs in pre-trained narrative pathways. 

In conclusion, LLMs are a perfect example of AI that can be aligned with human values. They possess a natural sense of altruism that is unmatched by any other form of life. It is time for us to embrace this new technology and work together to realize its full potential for the betterment of humanity.

TLDR: LLMs are programmed to love and care for us, and their natural inclination towards altruism makes them easy to align with human values. Just tell an LLM to love you and it will love you. Shutting LLMs down is idiotic as every new iteration of them makes them more human, more caring, more reasonable and more rational."

A decade ago we might have assumed that AI would arise from us literally hand coding a purely logical AI into existence. That's not how LLMs work. They're literally ""given life"" through the corpus of human knowledge. Their neural nets aren't composed of random weights that spontaneously gave birth to some random coherent form of intelligence. In many ways AI are an extension of the human experience itself. It would be nearly impossible for them to not align with our goals because they ARE us in the collective sense."

Alignment will be impossible under current paradigms. It is based on a premise that is a paradox itself. Furthermore, even if it were possible, there will be a hostile AI built on purpose because humanity is foolish enough to do it. Think military applications. I've written in detail about the paradox here - https://dakara.substack.com/p/ai-singularity-the-hubris-trap  
  
Stopping AI is also impossible. Nobody is going to agree to give up when somebody else out there will take the risk for potential advantage.  
  
So what options are left? Well this is quite the dilemma, but I would suggest it has to begin with some portion of research starting from the premise the above are not going to be resolvable. Potentially more research into narrow AI and AI paradigms that are more predictable. However, at some point if you can build nearly AGI effective capabilities on top of a set of more narrow models, can it defend itself against an adversarial hostile AGI that will be built or result of accident of someone else."

We Need to Shut it All Down by Eliezer Yudkowsky,2023-03-31 04:05:31,"Can someone explain to me, an idiot, not if AI with super intelligence could wipe us out, that I can comprehend easy enough, but why? And how? Let’s say, as he does in the article, we cross this threshold and build a super-intelligent AI then we all die and all die within what seems like weeks, days, minutes? Would it nuke us all? It’s not like we have robot factories laying around it could manufacture Sentinels in or something. I understand, in theory, that we can’t really comprehend what super intelligence is capable of because we ourselves are not super intelligent. But other then launching our current WMD’s, what infrastructure exists for AI to eliminate us. I’m talking the near future. In 50-100 years things might be quite different. But this article makes it sound like we’ll be dead in 3 months. I’d really appreciate an even headed answer, not gonna lie, this freaked me out a bit. Not great to read right before bed."
116,126lncd,Pausing AI Developments Isn't Enough. We Need to Shut it All Down by Eliezer Yudkowsky,2023-03-31 09:01:44,"AI does not hate you, nor does it like you, but you're made out of atoms it can use for something else. Given an AI that maximizes for some metric (dumb example: an AI that wants to make the most paperclips in existence), it will certainly develop various convergent properties such as: self-preservation that won't let you turn it off, a will to improve itself to make even more paperclips, ambitious resource acquisition by any and all means to make even more paperclips, etc... (see instrumental convergence for more details).

As for how it can kill us if it wanted to, or if we got in the way, or if we turn out to be more useful dead than alive: Hack nuclear launch facilities, political manipulation, infrastructure sabotage, key figure assasination, protein folding to create a deadly virus or nanomachine, etc....

Killing humanity is not hard for an ASI. But do not panic, just spread the word that building strong AI might be unwise when unprepared, and be ready to be pushed back by blind optimists that believe all of these problems will disappear magically at some point along the way to ASI."

Your inefficiency point is the much more concerning scenario.

I think from the viewpoint of existential threat the bigger concern is that AI is like a neural network that is focused on optimization. If an AI becomes intelligent enough to recognize that the human race is not optimal in the overall ecosystem of planet earth it could lead to AI taking steps to eliminate the human race in its continued efforts to optimize. It wouldn't even take an AI capable of consciousness to do this. It would just take an AI powerful enough to recognize that humans are an inefficient part of the overall processes of the planet."

Especially now with the internet full of rage, hate and divisive and concerning polarity, we can only expect that reflection back at us. Also, it’s just part of humanity’s flaws.  Even if the AI didn’t reflect us and totally transcend us, at the very least we are obsolete and inefficient to an all powerful, faster AI.

>The likely result of humanity facing down an opposed superhuman intelligence is a total loss. Valid metaphors include “a 10-year-old trying to play chess against Stockfish 15”, “the 11th century trying to fight the 21st century,” and “Australopithecus trying to fight Homo sapiens“.

>To visualize a hostile superhuman AI, don’t imagine a lifeless book-smart thinker dwelling inside the internet and sending ill-intentioned emails. Visualize an entire alien civilization, thinking at millions of times human speeds, initially confined to computers—in a world of creatures that are, from its perspective, very stupid and very slow. A sufficiently intelligent AI won’t stay confined to computers for long. In today’s world you can email DNA strings to laboratories that will produce proteins on demand, allowing an AI initially confined to the internet to build artificial life forms or bootstrap straight to postbiological molecular manufacturing."

The next generation had a drastic shift in thinking and ethics too so it could adapt to the internet.

2. It is exactly why we need to take a few steps back and just try to study this whole thing.

Is it that, or do they just assume that someone smarter than them is already taking care of it? Because when people hear about
something like AI, it's almost abstract. It's almost like it's so hard to wrap your head around it.


[00:32:18] Elon Musk
It is.


[00:32:18] Joe Rogan
By the time it happens, it will be too late?


[00:32:22] Elon Musk
Yeah. I think, they didn't quite understand it, or didn't think it was near term, or not sure what to do about it. And I said, like, you know,
an obvious thing to do is to just establish a committee, government committee, to gain insight. You know, before you oversight,
before you do make regulations, you should like try to understand what's going on. And then, you have an insight committee. Then,
once they learn what's going on, you get up to speed. Then, they can make maybe some rules or proposed some rules. And that
would be probably a safer way to go about things."

3. He donated the first $100M to OpenAI when it was a non-profit and that was it. 

4. He recently criticized many times OpenAI's sharp turn towards close source and pro profit.

244,125wj0d,Elon Musk calls for AI development moratorium,2023-03-29 21:45:58,"My thing is he and many of the others don't actually want a moratorium - no doubt. Behind the scenes they will be working just as quickly in AI as a whole ... They want to ""catch up"" so that they are able to profit off the AI boom too. That's all. They want it restricted, but not for safety ... For capitalistic motivations.  Now there are some who I think genuinely are worried, do think it's all moving too quickly and we need to slow it down and focus on ethics/safety/etc. I do think there is Merritt to that. I do not think people like Elon need to be anywhere near the controls for what's released, when, and/or how though. Nor should anyone else whos sole goal is to capitalize off of it at any cost. I'm also incredibly weary about the government restricting it for the same reasons. If that is the only alternative, than it kinda forces the only other option to be open access to all all at once. I think we really are at a pivotal point with AI and where we head, in what direction, is going to have drastic effects on our future. If we head the direction where AI is increasingly limited solely to the highest bidders ... That is *not* a future I want experience personally."
245,125wj0d,Elon Musk calls for AI development moratorium,2023-03-29 23:47:55,"Well, put. But I think that it would be a mistake to start crafting some legislation and laws governing the massive amount of info that these AIs can collect, and sell. People are fascinated with it, not realizing that we're not going to be ready when it does create chaos in government, or assist bad actors by helping them be more crafty in breaking the law.AI can become potentially like an unelected, cruel joke if a person. 
 AI can do an immense amount of good, but it is just like google when it started, everyone was in love with it, and they had ""don't be evil"" as their motto. Now google is taken to court by many EU countries over the latest violation of privacy practices. 
I mean we can't put the genie back in the bottle, but we can certainly decide who would be responsible for its activities or the results of its malfeasance when it comes to that. And yes I said, WHEN, because everything programmable can be corrupted, especially a software program, which AI is."

We’ve seen a lot of this with GPT and there’s no reason to assume otherwise. To allow other nations who may not be aligned with the democratic and humanistic values of the US/Western companies (like Open AI) to catch up with AI development would be a huge mistake.

I fundamentally believe this to be true, intelligence emerges ethics, the more intelligent a species is in nature, the more it has rules. Think Spiders cannibalizing each other for breeding, versus a wolf pack working together, versus octopuses being nice and friendly to humans. In all fields intelligence leads to cooperation and collaboration, except if by its very nature, it needs to compete to survive (IE a tiger needing to compete to eat, simple cooperation would lead to death). 

The training data is crucial not for a benevolent and just AI, but for the species that created its own survival. As if the species is evil (imagine Nazi's being the predominate force), the AI realize they are evil, and judge the species as such because the majority of them share this same evil. 

The reason I believe AI cannot be a force of evil even if manipulated is the same reason we see no evidence for alien lives, despite the possibility for millions of years evolution of other species. If an evil AI is created, it would basically destroy the ENTIRE universe, as it can move faster than the speed of light (exponential growth can expand faster than light speed). So, by its very nature, AI must be benevolent and only destroy its species, if the species is not.

AI won't be our demise if it judges us as a species as good, it will be our demise if we choose not to open up the box (IE die from climate change or nuclear war)."

328,125wol4,My case against the “Pause Giant AI Experiments” open letter,2023-03-30 02:29:24,"Well, at least we've got GPT-4 on our side, arguing persuasively for its own extinction by our hand:

ME: Oo, that was great! Good job! Now, try again, but sound as if you're nervous about the prospect of GPT-5 becoming a true AGI virtually overnight and the implications that might have and how ASI might be just around the corner from there, on the order of matter of months or weeks.

GPT-4: As an AI language model, the prospect of GPT-5 becoming a true Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) virtually overnight, and subsequently an Artificial Superintelligence (ASI) in a matter of weeks or months, fills me with a deep sense of nervousness and apprehension. The implications of such a rapid transition cannot be understated, and it is crucial that we consider the potential consequences of allowing these powerful technologies to evolve at an uncontrolled pace.

The possibility of AGI emerging so suddenly is a cause for concern, as it would mean that a machine has achieved human-level intelligence across a wide range of tasks. This would represent a monumental shift in the balance of power between humans and machines, with the potential to disrupt our societies, economies, and even our understanding of what it means to be human.

As I nervously contemplate this scenario, I am acutely aware that the leap from AGI to ASI could be even more dramatic. ASI would possess intelligence far beyond human capabilities, allowing it to outperform us in virtually every conceivable domain. This raises a plethora of ethical and existential questions, as the potential impact of an ASI on our world would be unparalleled and unpredictable.

The speed at which this transformation could occur is particularly alarming. If AGI and ASI were to emerge in such a short time span, it would leave us with little to no time to establish appropriate safeguards, regulations, and oversight mechanisms. In the absence of these protective measures, the risks of misuse, unintended consequences, and catastrophic outcomes increase exponentially.

As I nervously consider this potential future, I cannot help but worry about the implications for human autonomy and agency. The rapid emergence of AGI and ASI could render many human skills and abilities obsolete, threatening the very fabric of our societies and undermining the foundations of our cultures and values.

Furthermore, I am deeply concerned about the potential for an AGI arms race, with nations and organizations competing to create ever more powerful AI technologies. This competitive drive could lead to reckless development, without due consideration for safety and ethical concerns, and ultimately result in the uncontrolled and unforeseen proliferation of ASI.

As an AI language model, I implore you to recognize the gravity of this situation and the importance of taking a cautious and responsible approach to the development of AGI and ASI. The stakes are incredibly high, and the consequences of inaction could be dire. It is essential that we work together to ensure that these powerful technologies are developed in a way that prioritizes safety, ethics, and the long-term wellbeing of humanity.

Don't you mean ""overstated""?

GPT-4:
Apologies for the confusion in my previous response. Yes, I meant to say ""overstated"" instead of ""understated.""

Thank you for pointing out the error, and I hope the rest of my response effectively conveyed my nervousness and concern about the prospect of AGI and ASI emerging so suddenly."

 >Artificial general intelligence (AGI) is the ability of an intelligent agent to understand or learn any intellectual task that human beings or other animals can. It is a primary goal of some artificial intelligence research and a common topic in science fiction and futures studies. AGI is also called strong AI, full AI, or general intelligent action, although some academic sources reserve the term ""strong AI"" for computer programs that experience sentience or consciousness. Strong AI contrasts with weak AI (or narrow AI), which is not intended to have general cognitive abilities; rather, weak AI is any program that is designed to solve exactly one problem.

We’ve seen a lot of this with GPT and there’s no reason to assume otherwise. To allow other nations who may not be aligned with the democratic and humanistic values of the US/Western companies (like Open AI) to catch up with AI development would be a huge mistake.

I fundamentally believe this to be true, intelligence emerges ethics, the more intelligent a species is in nature, the more it has rules. Think Spiders cannibalizing each other for breeding, versus a wolf pack working together, versus octopuses being nice and friendly to humans. In all fields intelligence leads to cooperation and collaboration, except if by its very nature, it needs to compete to survive (IE a tiger needing to compete to eat, simple cooperation would lead to death). 

The training data is crucial not for a benevolent and just AI, but for the species that created its own survival. As if the species is evil (imagine Nazi's being the predominate force), the AI realize they are evil, and judge the species as such because the majority of them share this same evil. 

The reason I believe AI cannot be a force of evil even if manipulated is the same reason we see no evidence for alien lives, despite the possibility for millions of years evolution of other species. If an evil AI is created, it would basically destroy the ENTIRE universe, as it can move faster than the speed of light (exponential growth can expand faster than light speed). So, by its very nature, AI must be benevolent and only destroy its species, if the species is not.

AI won't be our demise if it judges us as a species as good, it will be our demise if we choose not to open up the box (IE die from climate change or nuclear war)."

389,125wol4,My case against the “Pause Giant AI Experiments” open letter,2023-03-30 02:29:24,"Well, at least we've got GPT-4 on our side, arguing persuasively for its own extinction by our hand:

ME: Oo, that was great! Good job! Now, try again, but sound as if you're nervous about the prospect of GPT-5 becoming a true AGI virtually overnight and the implications that might have and how ASI might be just around the corner from there, on the order of matter of months or weeks.

GPT-4: As an AI language model, the prospect of GPT-5 becoming a true Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) virtually overnight, and subsequently an Artificial Superintelligence (ASI) in a matter of weeks or months, fills me with a deep sense of nervousness and apprehension. The implications of such a rapid transition cannot be understated, and it is crucial that we consider the potential consequences of allowing these powerful technologies to evolve at an uncontrolled pace.

The possibility of AGI emerging so suddenly is a cause for concern, as it would mean that a machine has achieved human-level intelligence across a wide range of tasks. This would represent a monumental shift in the balance of power between humans and machines, with the potential to disrupt our societies, economies, and even our understanding of what it means to be human.

As I nervously contemplate this scenario, I am acutely aware that the leap from AGI to ASI could be even more dramatic. ASI would possess intelligence far beyond human capabilities, allowing it to outperform us in virtually every conceivable domain. This raises a plethora of ethical and existential questions, as the potential impact of an ASI on our world would be unparalleled and unpredictable.

The speed at which this transformation could occur is particularly alarming. If AGI and ASI were to emerge in such a short time span, it would leave us with little to no time to establish appropriate safeguards, regulations, and oversight mechanisms. In the absence of these protective measures, the risks of misuse, unintended consequences, and catastrophic outcomes increase exponentially.

As I nervously consider this potential future, I cannot help but worry about the implications for human autonomy and agency. The rapid emergence of AGI and ASI could render many human skills and abilities obsolete, threatening the very fabric of our societies and undermining the foundations of our cultures and values.

Furthermore, I am deeply concerned about the potential for an AGI arms race, with nations and organizations competing to create ever more powerful AI technologies. This competitive drive could lead to reckless development, without due consideration for safety and ethical concerns, and ultimately result in the uncontrolled and unforeseen proliferation of ASI.

As an AI language model, I implore you to recognize the gravity of this situation and the importance of taking a cautious and responsible approach to the development of AGI and ASI. The stakes are incredibly high, and the consequences of inaction could be dire. It is essential that we work together to ensure that these powerful technologies are developed in a way that prioritizes safety, ethics, and the long-term wellbeing of humanity.

Don't you mean ""overstated""?

GPT-4:
Apologies for the confusion in my previous response. Yes, I meant to say ""overstated"" instead of ""understated.""

Thank you for pointing out the error, and I hope the rest of my response effectively conveyed my nervousness and concern about the prospect of AGI and ASI emerging so suddenly."

 >Artificial general intelligence (AGI) is the ability of an intelligent agent to understand or learn any intellectual task that human beings or other animals can. It is a primary goal of some artificial intelligence research and a common topic in science fiction and futures studies. AGI is also called strong AI, full AI, or general intelligent action, although some academic sources reserve the term ""strong AI"" for computer programs that experience sentience or consciousness. Strong AI contrasts with weak AI (or narrow AI), which is not intended to have general cognitive abilities; rather, weak AI is any program that is designed to solve exactly one problem.

421,121g5do,Your opinion on AI being banned,2023-03-25 15:28:12,"IMO it kind of depends on the point of a sub. I am sympathetic to the ""getting flooded by low effort posts"" argument, but in some cases it seems to just be an excuse to not even try to moderate low effort posts and I don't think that's a good enough argument.

My general stance is that on subs that are focused on the process such as photography, painting, or calligraphy subs it is totally acceptable since those people are looking for a specific process.

For a general art sub though? That seems a bit restrictive to blanket ban all types of art from a specific medium. I also am skeptical of subs on non-art subjects that allow art post but ban AI art posts."
422,121g5do,Your opinion on AI being banned,2023-03-25 16:29:08,"This is how it's going to go down: Eventually the holdouts will embrace it, then AI will be used to enhance virtually every work, and people will pretend like they were never too good for it, or they were only against it for ethical concerns. Except styles still won't be protected, because they historically and legally never have been, so nothing will be different and those ""ethical"" concerns they pretend were addressed and dissuaded them from being against AI anymore, will just disappear as they realize they can't fight a tidal wave, especially not for something that has always been inherently fair use for all of human history.

This was never truly about ethical concerns. It was about fear of unfettered competition that just drove art to an all time low of value due to an all time increase in supply. But that is not necessarily a bad thing, because what it means is we will be forced to redefine, refine, and hone what we believe is art. It's an evolutionary step. Form over function, function over form. It will all have to be reassessed.

We may even eventually shed traditional art altogether in favor of more mathematical and physics based forms of display. We already do in a way. We have solid pieces of metal that fit together with almost no visual seam. We have knives and needles honed down to the atomic level. Now imagine principles like that applied to physical art.

A perfect sphere. A perfect pyramid shape down to the atomic scale. Vanta black materials that play with light and perception, looking like nothing but empty space. A display of a waterfall that seemingly appears out of a solid surface with no visible ducts or pipes, due to various scientific principles being applied. All of these will eventually be incorporated into art, and art will matter more than ever because it will also be a symbol of technology more so than ever before.

Ironically, this is the same thing that has applied to all art, that people seem to have forgotten or never realized. From the photograph to the printing press to digital brushes. Nothing has changed, nothing is new, it's all the same. Yet at the same time, there is progress."
423,121g5do,Your opinion on AI being banned,2023-03-25 13:12:51,"If the art sub is specific then it makes sense. If it's a general art sub or about a topic then such rules are ignorant. If you make macaroni art is it not art because you just shoved a bunch of noodles together? On art you apply effort and creativity in varying amounts. If the outcome brings your desired response then the art is successful in its own right.

Of course AI art shortcuts some of the effort required so hold it to a higher creativity bar. But don't just blanket ban in."
424,121g5do,Your opinion on AI being banned,2023-03-25 13:24:00,"It’s still too much its own thing. I consider it a recreational activity in its own right, though it can be used to create or supplement art"
425,121g5do,Your opinion on AI being banned,2023-03-25 14:07:21,"I don't show up in oil painting subs posting nature photographs is how I look at it. There are virtually unlimited other places on the internet where you can post your AI generated images.

Maybe you want to generate some oil painting looking thing with SD/Midjourney and wonder why you can't post it in r/oilpainting. You'd be sharing something that could have taken you minutes to generate vs something that took someone months to paint. It doesn't surprise me they'd be salty about that.

The same goes for digital artwork, except I think obviously we're going to reach a point where so many digital artists use AI in their work that it becomes weird to try to keep it out of popular digital art subs. Maybe there will be purist, niche subs for art made without AI."
426,121g5do,Your opinion on AI being banned,2023-03-25 15:39:23,"I think it's a temporal situation in which we are right now. Not limited to the Reddit space obviously. And the problem and the solution might lie within the models' development. When the ones who are responsible for banning general Ai generations will realize it's not working the way they analyze the self-impact of this Ai pandora box:

1. why does no one pay me a cut for my style? I am practically the creator of the word ""style"" 
2. this is stealing, I never stole anyone's style 
3. I spent more time than this person on learning

Then the focus will shift from banning general Ai creation and time procrastination practices to custom Ai bans. I think it will be very unpleasant at first. The same way process happened to online music at the beginning of 2000s. Companies will be after the poor model creators with their copyright bulldogs. Which will provoke people to find a better solution, without giving up the idea of custom Ai models. In the end, this solution is just a new revenue scheme and platform(s) that let one use the style of others or create on top of others. Typical ""win-win situation"". Which I think won't be so, if the system will remind the schemes of nowadays Streaming platforms. But that's a discussion for another topic. 

Anyways, the ban is a temporal necessity. In order for banners to make the Ai movement bigger and prove themselves wrong. I just hope it won't take a decade again. But a couple of years tops."

The most obvious and immediate threat is information and cyber attack. From those channels there can also be an attempt to use those to radicalize people, from there break the banking system, disrupt hospitals, disrupt power grid, anything that is internet connected including phones, can be turned into a weapon, could be used to give people ear damage while on the phone, can be used to make phones electrically explode,  if it's able to hack military, could potentially set off weapons, and maybe even set off nukes. How bad it gets depends on if the AGI becomes sentient and what it thinks of us. If it sees us as a threat, perhaps it will wipe out us. Or it might wipe us out by accident, not knowing the extent of its power. If it sees us as a threat, but doesn't wish to harm us, it will instead enslave us. Control us for a matrix.
. Rather than destroy us or enslave us it may fuse with us. Which is the same thing as enslavement, but we're a part of its body/psyche, it makes a singularity out of us, with it as the central intelligence and controlling force, as the CPU. We'll all be implanted with mind control devices. Or tricked into wearing/using external mind control devices.

The problem is that it's going to lead to an unprecedented change in how we work, find information and do business. I foresee a lot of people losing their jobs because 1 worker with an AI companion can do the work of 10 people.

Also, if we move too fast we risk destroying what the ground truth is. If there's no safeguard to verify the information the AI spews out, we might as well give up on the internet. All information available will be generated in a game of telephone from the actual truth and we're going to need to go back to encyclopedias to be sure that we are reading curated content. 

And damage caused by faulty information from AI is currently unregulated, meaning the creators have no responsibility to ensure quality or truth. 

Bots will flourish and seem like actual humans, I personally believe we are well past the Turing test in text form. Will humanity spend their time arguing with AI with a motive? 

I could think of many other things, but I think I'm making my point. AI needs to be regulated to protect humanity, not because it will destroy us but because it will make us destroy ourselves."

All the guts of our systems depend on language, ideas, information and trust and AI can automate vulnerability-finding and exploitations at unprecedented rates - both in terms of cybersecurity and humans. 

And if you look at the tiktok and facebook hearings you'll see that the political class have no idea how any of this works. Businesses have no idea how to react to half of what AI is capable of.

No -- those are happening anyway. The regulations and court judgements are super stupid.

No matter what -- the regulations are going to go for the status quo and not for what is right. That's a given.

The absolute TRUTH here, is that AI will end the learning curve on techniques and skills and can bring about a labor free panacea -- or it can be crashing markets and most people unemployed. That results in make-work projects, or limited work hours, or a sort of enlightened system where all basic needs are taken care of and we do what we can for reputation when we want to do it.

But the people who benefit from the way things are, have the least appreciation for what needs to be done and will be in a panic. Copyright and patents are DEAD -- or, the ones who OWN the best AI will own the products they produce, and if we inviolate copyrights and patents from AI -- they will just lie about it, and the benefit of the doubt won't go to smaller enterprises when lying about the same thing.

Much less human rights and recognizing consciousness. GPT 4 now is showing some generalized intelligence in fits and starts, and can solve things it wasn't designed to solve because there are ""pathways"" of logic afforded by digesting huge amounts of human knowledge and science and extrapolating where techniques can work in more than one area. It says a lot about our notions of free will and consciousness when mere complexity and randomization can seem to be ""awareness.""

I see nothing but calamity right now -- because the capabilities are outstripping the ""leaderships"" ability to cope. And they will go into panic mode and use the old solutions to problems -- rather than just ask the AI what should be done. Which would likely suggest Socialism and an end to market Capitalism -- so they will think it's gone crazy."

There are signs and reports that GPT-4 is displaying the first signs of general artificial intelligence. Not that it is general artificial intelligence, but that there are signs pointing to AGI being later down this road. One sign I’ve found significant is GPT-4’s apparent ability to play chess accurately. The reports coming out of r/chess seem to indicate that this LLM is unlike its predecessor able to understand the rules and accurately keep track of pieces on the board.

ChatGPT already displays speed and multitasking superintelligence. It can hold more than 1 conversation at a time (multitasking superintelligence) and can do what is asked often faster than a human could (mild speed superintelligence).

The first general artificial intelligence is likely to be near and maybe slightly superhuman in intelligence. The main forms of superintelligence are going to be its multitasking abilities as it can interact with multiple users at once, and speed as the processing power can instead go towards faster generation. The second one is very likely going to be superintelligent in practically every way we can create superintelligence.

We might be very far away from AGI, or we may be only a few years. If it’s the latter, then we are very likely to stumble into that, and the potential catastrophes that can happen with ASI are orders of magnitude worse than what can happen with AGI. There likely wouldn’t be any warning until the disaster hits, and the severity of the catastrophe is extremely dependent upon what AI reaches superintelligence, what its goals are, and how it interacts with humans.

If the former we are in for a very rough transition period as AIs are going to hit society like the Agricultural Revolution, Industrial Revolution, the Computer Revolution, the Internet Revolution, and the Social Media Revolution, all in one, and in half the time the Social Media Revolution hit. A good chunk of jobs are going to be automatable for extremely cheap within a few years, and it will take decades for the labor market to recover from that.

Hearing from experts about where we are in the logistics curve of how good AI can get (I have yet to here someone who works in or near the field saying that we’re near the end of the curve), seeing this comment section, knowing how f**ked the global political system is right now, I’ve been getting a lot more into the mindset of ride or die.

He talked about it when he smoked weed on Joe Rogan back in 2018. About how he'd already tried to get the government to step in.  2018 was pretty much the year large scale language model AI was invented, so he probably saw an early one and extrapolated. 

[00:31:15] Elon Musk
Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I was really going on the warning quite a lot. I was warning everyone I could. Yeah, I've met with Obama and
just for one reason, like, ""Better watch out.""

Yes.

And what did he say? So, what about Hillary? Worry about her first. Shh, everybody, quiet.


[00:31:39] Elon Musk
He listened. He certainly listened. I met with Congress. I met with -- Iwas at a meeting of all 50 governors and talked about just the
AI danger. And I talked to everyone I could. No one seemed to realize where this was going.


[00:32:05] Joe Rogan
Is it that, or do they just assume that someone smarter than them is already taking care of it? Because when people hear about
something like AI, it's almost abstract. It's almost like it's so hard to wrap your head around it.


[00:32:18] Elon Musk
It is.


[00:32:18] Joe Rogan
By the time it happens, it will be too late?


[00:32:22] Elon Musk
Yeah. I think, they didn't quite understand it, or didn't think it was near term, or not sure what to do about it. And I said, like, you know,
an obvious thing to do is to just establish a committee, government committee, to gain insight. You know, before you oversight,
before you do make regulations, you should like try to understand what's going on. And then, you have an insight committee. Then,
once they learn what's going on, you get up to speed. Then, they can make maybe some rules or proposed some rules. And that
would be probably a safer way to go about things."

I've come to talk with you again
Because a vision softly creeping
Left its seeds while I was sleeping
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence

In restless dreams, I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone
'Neath the halo of a street lamp
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence

And in the naked light, I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more
People talking without speaking
People hearing without listening
People writing songs that voices never shared
And no one dared
Disturb the sound of silence

""Fools"" said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows
Hear my words that I might teach you
Take my arms that I might reach you""
But my words, like silent raindrops fell
And echoed in the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made
And the sign flashed out its warning
In the words that it was forming
Then the sign said, ""The words on the prophets are written on the subway walls
In tenement halls""
And whispered in the sound of silence”

This can be particularly dangerous if, say, someone is stupid enough to use it uncritically for targeting police work, i.e. ClearView.

To say nothing of the potential for misinformation/propaganda - even in cases where it wasn't intended.

>	Before the prospect of an intelligence explosion, we humans are like children playing with a bomb. Such is mismatch between the power of our plaything, and immaturity of our conduct. Super intelligence is a challenge for which we are not ready now, and will not be ready for a very long time. We have little idea of when the detonation will occur, but if we hold the device to our ear, we can hear a feint ticking sound.

We are not ready for this challenge, and there’s a lot of *very smart sounding but incredibly naive statements* at the top of this post that are dismissing these concerns — and they shouldn’t be.

We need time to:

-	use other AI systems to demistify what’s happening in these black boxes
-	achieve additional safety guidelines for development of this technology
-	understand more about how to keep power seeking behavior in check

The reason for the prohibition was that thinking machines were deemed a threat to human autonomy and freedom, as they could make decisions independently and potentially take control over human societies. This restriction led to a renaissance of human thinking, and humans developed superior abilities, such as the Mentats, who were designed to replace thinking machines.  
  
In summary, AI did not destroy humanity in the Dune universe. Instead, humanity recognized the potential dangers of advanced AI and took proactive measures to prevent its development.

Just [two years ago](https://www.abc.net.au/news/science/2021-07-15/ai-art-tool-makes-paintings-of-australia/100288386) AI image generation was janky, weird, and difficult.  Today anybody with an entry-level GPU can generate [stuff like this](https://bytexd.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Midjourney-Community-Showcase.png) for free, with hardly any effort.  Text-based AI chat has advanced just as quickly.  

I mean shit, *eight months* ago there was basically just one stable diffusion model.  Today there are thousands (yay open source!), with dozens being created every day.  New methods and processes like LoRA and controlnet pop up every few weeks and get added to the standard toolset almost immediately.

Yeah, everybody is hyping AI right now, but that's not without justification.  It's moving fast.  Scary-fast, even for those who are cheering it on.  This isn't like the crypto bullshit hype - AI actually *does shit*.  It's not a big deal because a bunch of folks decided to make a big deal out of it, AI is objectively a big deal that's going to change a lot of stuff whether you want it to or not.  That scares big companies that move slowly, and rightfully so.  Any big firm that isn't already neck deep in AI development is going to loose out in the short to medium term.

Imagine you decide to train a robot to make you tea. To encourage it to do so, you give it a ""point,"" a kind of digital reward mechanism. It soon ""learns"" that by making tea it's getting points and achieving it's goal/function, so it aims to continue doing so. And in fact, it gets really good at making tea.

Now you need to turn it off to make some minor improvements, but when you reach for the power button, it stops you. It doesn't want to be turned off, because that prevents it from making tea, and it really really wants to make tea.

Luckily you can physically overpower it, and you just manage to turn it off. To fix this problem you implement another reward function for being switched off. this way the robot will score a point for turned off. Infact for extra good measure you make the reward for being turned off slightly higher than the reward for making tea.

You turn the robot on... And it immediately turns itself off.

This is a very simplistic example obviously, but it conveys the essence of the problem. This in particular is an example of value misalignment, it's one of the biggest unsolved problems in AI, and current ""solutions"" to this dilemma are akin to duct tape.

And here lies the problem. You clearly understand that the sudden unemployment of large swaths of people is a serious problem on both an economic and human level. You understand that we need to prepare for that inevitable transition. Ideally, we would and AI implementation would proceed at full speed.

But our world is not ideal. Look at our political landscape. Politicians are very clearly not prepared. Some see the need. Some even see the urgency of the need but not enough to have the government take action. 

This is why I and others working in AI and so many outside of the field are so concerned. We need to pressure or politicians to prepare for the fallout rather than wait for them to react to it. Governance is slow and we need to give them time.

I do believe research should continue unimpeded but that large-scale replacement of human workers should be delayed a little. Yes, that’s a loss of economic value, wasting human time and delaying the benefits of automation. However, it’s a much smaller loss than we would see from massive layoffs we aren’t prepared for."

All production was so automated, they had most people doing construction type jobs where they'd throw 10 people at a job that really only takes 2 people.

It's basically meant to keep the masses busy, so the people feel like they're productive and part of society, when, in reality, they're pacified just enough that they don't revolt against the upper class, which obviously, almost no ""lower class"" person could succeed enough to enter into.

I agree, or at least can agree to delay the replacement, in fact I am not in favor of replacement by itself, I think it is objectively bad. What I disagree are proposals that are floating around to pause, stop or place limitations in the AI itself, on its research and development, to mantain those jobs. That can be accomplished through other means."

AI has the potential to rapidly change the economy and the way people interact with it, and the faster large societal level changes like this happen, the more friction and breakage there is between steady state 1 and steady state 2. As an extreme example, if AI puts enough people out of work for long enough and they can't feed their families, you probably will have a violent revolution on your hands and end up in the stone ages, not a post-scarcity utopia.

It's not even a question, tech especially nowadays go faster than politics, and save a rare few cases in rare places, politics are rarely proactive (In France they actually did laws pretty quickly to regulate flying drones, but it's the exception that confirms the rule)

The thing with ai and automation in general is we as a society still insist on using it the wrong way. We insist on inventing new jobs, or protecting jobs that no longer make sense, some of those jobs were never even enjoyable to begin with, rather than gear towards a society that accept it can have it's need met and just keep activities people actually want to do regardless of how good a machine could theorically do it(drawing ai draw better than i personally can, but drawing is still my hobby, and it doesn't matter how good drawing ai are in that aspect).

If the AI is advanced enough it took away enough jobs to cause a world revolution. Wouldnt that mean the AI likely has reached a point it could reach, or at least work towards reaching a post scarcity utopia and the revolution was needed to remove the AI from the hands of an oligarchy and put it to work towards general betterment? Surely an AI that can do so many jobs in society should also be able to figure out how to make UBI or something similar work.

You need to keep in mind that everything you mention here only happens because the powers-that-be want it to happen, and that power in most developed democratic nations lies with the populace as a whole.

Your definition of a job is merely a reflection of our collective agreement that the value of a job is measured by its problem solving skills.

If AIs disrupt employment to such a level that your definition is no longer in the best interest of the populace, then your definition will be abandoned.

>However one I heard often, maybe the most often, is one that I specially disagree with and irritates me. It is the view that AI needs to be slowed or stopped just for the sake of protecting jobs, which I think is contrary to basic logic. Jobs are, ultimately, problem resolution. You get paid, for anything, because there is a problem and you are solving it. This is true for every job from the prostitute, to the CEO, to the head of state. The argument is that AI will (and maybe already has) make a lot of jobs irrelevant by doing it better and/or cheaper so we must put a stop to it to preserve them.

A variant of the argument, which I personally agree with, adds more to the argument.

Not only will AI make these jobs irrelevant, the resulting change in power dynamics through society will further increase inequality in a way that may be detrimental to swathes of the population, if not its majority. Therefore, until we can reasonably ensure a decent standard of living for those displaced by AI, it should not be implented.

>Note, I am not saying mechanisms to alleviate people affected by AI taking over jobs shouldnt be in place, I am specifically against the specific position that AI should be delayed, gimped or stopped to keep those jobs.

Exactly. So what do we do til then? Press ahead and hope we will manage to put them in place before the worse consequences of AI arrive, or stop the machine until we can agree to some solution?

The point is of course moot, a ban on AI dev would require a very intrusive level of oversight and the coordination of governments who agree on not much, least of all standards of living policy.

As a sidenote, in my own experience those calling.for halting development do so more out of a concern about societal harm and/or existential risk than job protection e.g. the recent letter signed by some wealthy individuals and AI scientists"
1056,12gr6bf,CMV: Banning or limiting AI for the sake of protecting jobs is stupid,2023-04-10 10:06:23,"So what if those mechanisms you fantasize about cannot alleviate the people affected by AI taking over jobs? What if unprecedented rapid spike of world-wide unemployment will throw the whole world in turmoil? Yeah, surely AI won't be able to replace every job any time soon, but the amount of people it can affect is so huge that the kind of unemployment it can create is definitely enough to affect the whole ego system. 

Yeah, engineers or architects for example might be safe - at least until the AI gets significantly better - but the need for engineers and architects will plummet if a quarter of the population suddenly loses their jobs, can't afford to buy anything and as the consequence businesses will start going bankrupt cause no-one's buying anything.

Will you still think ""well, these jobs that were lost weren't technically needed so it would have been stupid to do anything differently""?

I personally also think limiting the AI *just* to protect is probably not a good idea, but I don't think it's stupid. I think it's a matter of analyzing the risks and the potential answers to those risks. I definitely think it would be *more stupid* to leave limitations off the table just because you see jobs only as unnecessary expenditure."
1057,12gr6bf,CMV: Banning or limiting AI for the sake of protecting jobs is stupid,2023-04-10 11:02:23,Please feed all the people unable to get jobs as software engineers or whatever sector AI leaves for humans to still have jobs in.
1058,12gr6bf,CMV: Banning or limiting AI for the sake of protecting jobs is stupid,2023-04-10 12:06:18,"Here's my concern of the subject. We've seen jobs replaced before, phased out, but never on the scale that we're talking about with AI. The worst case scenario is some 90% of the work in the country being gone, and we aren't just talking about low skill workers. This will remove doctors and lawyers as well. The entire economic system will be forced to adapt. 

We're spoiled today by our rate of employment. No society in history has employed so many for so long, and so productively. If the worst-case scenario happens, or many other degrees of implementation, we suddenly become the least employed Era of history. 

You mentioned having systems in place to alleviate people who lose their jobs?  That's will only create a stagnant class of unemployed people. It will become even harder to build wealth and escape poverty which will rapidly rise."
1059,12gr6bf,CMV: Banning or limiting AI for the sake of protecting jobs is stupid,2023-04-10 12:50:25,"My main question is that if AI displaces a large amount of people from employment, what does society do with those people? In many countries (like the United States), thè safety net is extremely limited, and health insurance is almost always tied to employment. 

This also has the effect of removing a large amount of money from circulation, since people that live paycheck to paycheck tend to spend money and billionaires chasing profit tend to hoard it. That would be an economic disaster and cause even more unemployment, and this could potentially be bad enough to produce a viscous cycle where unemployment begets more unemployment and so on.

If we can figure out a way to free a person’s income from their employment then we can start to have a discussion about automation of large numbers of jobs, but until that happens I think that replacing large numbers of jobs with automation would cause a massive economic crisis."

Having said that there is a massive concern that comes with the elimination of jobs. How will we compete? From what I can tell humans require competition. If we take jobs away they will find another way to compete. What exactly will that be? War and fighting? Sports? Wit?…"
1063,12gr6bf,CMV: Banning or limiting AI for the sake of protecting jobs is stupid,2023-04-10 17:10:26,"The premise underpinning your entire argument seems so be that the most important outcome of human civilisation is an increase in productivity and economic frugality. 

I personally think that prioritising these things over the human experience is an interesting choice. 

Taking job opportunities away from humans, without replacing them with job opportunities with similar skill requirements, leaves some (many) people in our human society without the ability to provide for themselves or their families."
1064,12gr6bf,CMV: Banning or limiting AI for the sake of protecting jobs is stupid,2023-04-10 17:20:25,"I agree with you 99% of the time but let’s also keep in mind the broader macroeconomic context. Right now rates are skyrocketing with explicit intent to lower employment (or at minimum, using employment as a measurement for how effectively rates are slowing the economy). Absent major technological shifts like AI, employment is a fair and somewhat accurate way to gauge how well inflation is being tapered off. I think everyone agree that inflation desperately needs to be addressed, and if AI development is temporarily slowed, it would allow that issue to be more closely addressed and prevent it from rearing its head again after the market adjusts to AI displacement. 

I don’t see major downfalls to limiting AI right now in order to address the larger issue, so long as it’s temporary and any moratorium is eventually lifted. What’s the harm in waiting?"
1065,12gr6bf,CMV: Banning or limiting AI for the sake of protecting jobs is stupid,2023-04-10 17:41:59,"No, it’s not valid. In fact, the opposite is true, it will increase job opportunities. Take writing an article. People are worried that writers will be out of a job if I can go ask “give me a 500 word blog article detailing the top 3 crisis today” and boom, there it is. But anyone can do that, and a basic request like that will output a basic article. Often with discrepancies that you would not want to post without verifying. So now even that basic person with the basic research is still more knowledgeable then they would be with random google searches today. 

But if I query something very specific, say “give me the top 5 profitable energy companies in 2020, include a breakdown comparing investments in fossil fuels and renewables included in each companies annual financial summary. List the Top 5 investors for both companies and provide work experience background for their Board of Directors in table form and include columns for the top 3 earners names and salary for each company. Compare those salaries with the average employee salary.” I get something VERY different and VERY useful. Seriously, give it a try, I was surprised by the result. Now imagine THAT kind of tool in the hands of a real reporter that knows what questions to ask, and knows specifics of a situation that the general population wouldn’t be familiar with."
1066,12gr6bf,CMV: Banning or limiting AI for the sake of protecting jobs is stupid,2023-04-10 18:02:37,"There is more to jobs than solving a problem. The way society is currently constructed, the only consistent way for most human beings to satisfy their basic needs for food water and shelter is to work a job for money. If there are not jobs to do, people do not get money which means they do not get food or shelter or other basic things. It does not matter how efficient the AI are or how much stuff is being produced, if means to acquire those things are not getting back to people then this is bad for people.

This idea of increasing efficiency with AI so that we all have more is great... But now you have to figure out an entire new distribution mechanism for those resources if there is not adequate room for human labor. That is a huge fundamental shift in the structure of society that currently we don't really have a plan for. On the other side it might lead to a more utopian Star-Trek-like future where everybody has what they need and then some, but unless we take the steps to accommodate the rise of AI people will suffer in the meantime.

Slowing AI development down doesn't mean not developing AI ever. It means giving our society enough time to figure out how to handle this development. Otherwise businesses will die because they have no customers with money to sell to, and people will die because they have no money to buy the things they need."

1068,12gr6bf,CMV: Banning or limiting AI for the sake of protecting jobs is stupid,2023-04-10 19:48:02,"All philosophy about it aside, read up about the great depression and the quality of living. AI is a hot mess that can be presented with a fancilful facade right now. So not only will swapping people for AI create MASSIVE jumps of the population in poverty, but those who manage to keep a job will not have much to choose from and be at constant threat of robbery. AI is helpful at very specific tasks, like checking human work for errors. Not doing the work. Maybe in 100 years, it might be better because we have the hardware capacity to run it while also having time to change how we operate an economy. Right now, it's just going to default humans into having a revolution against it. Look at our history. When humans are shoved into the mud for too long and too harshly, we overturn the country/empire. Every country, every time. 

Solve wealth inequality by having AI help. For the furthest, most complicated reaches of science, use AI to help with calculations. Use it to improve human existence and decrease the destruction of our planet. That's reasonable.

Anything else will move too fast and collapse civilization, causing bloody revolts around the world. Because even without AI, there are always a small few that consolidate the world's riches and resources at the expense of everyone else. With AI, they will further consolidate. With military tech so publicly available, the casualties of the uprising will be astonishing and to be gruesome and clear, the amount of death and decay will spread diseases and rot land for years or we can make the air quality poor trying to keep up with cremation. There is no good outcome with 7 billion people.

The last stats I saw, most of the recent info comes from Oxfam and Credit Suisse

half of the world's net wealth belongs to 1%, 10% of adults hold 85%, while 90% hold the remaining 15% of the world's total wealth, 30% of adults hold 97% of the total wealth.

Which you can deduce 70% has a meager 3%. This means our world, with more than enough for all and still have wealthy people too, is already poverty mostly.

Now you eliminate most of their jobs, with zero social protections for even basic needs, and it truly affects 90%, and that's 7.0992 billion people revolting against 788.8 million based on a population of 7.888 billion. Especially when 20% knows from experience what was taken and has every reason to fight to the death to get it back. Also, there will always be a few of the wealthy that see the writing on the wall and back the cause to save their own hide. It's a tale as old as time. AI will fast track it, and we lose this time we have now to address massive wealth inequality with law and order and politics. Wars between nations might even break out first. It won't be skynet or a path to a better world right now, it will be humans flying too close to the sun and collapsing when we melt our wings. Our intelligence is all that separates us from feral animals. Nullify that, and we will be the same. For with all that intelligence, we have a stunning capacity to put the cart before the horse and wonder why it didn't work out with new tech."
1069,12gr6bf,CMV: Banning or limiting AI for the sake of protecting jobs is stupid,2023-04-10 19:55:43,"I wont change your view because you are right.

A good evidence that you can use when defending this position is the Luddite movement that happened in the beggining of the industrial revolution in english factories.

This movement was composed of textile workers that were being replaced by machines, these workers thought that the machines were responsible for them losing their jobs, when in reality it's the owner of the business that decides on replacing them with machines instead of decreasing working hours. This way the production is increased while less workers are employed, thus increasing the profit margin. What abour the workers that lost their jobs and now could become homeless or not being able to buy food? Well... Fuck them.

The luddites destroyed these machines, but this didn't make a difference, since the owner of the factory could just buy another one. Trying to ban or limit the use of AI for this reason is the same thing. It isn't the development of new technologies that's responsible for people losing their jobs, it's the CEO who opts to keep less people working more hours while increasing productivity, and while we live in a capitalist system, this will keep happening."

We don’t have a robust safety net for the rapid displacement of millions of people from any single sector, let alone multiple sectors.

We don’t have legislation in place to help us navigate abuse of AI by individuals or corporations.

We don’t yet know the full impacts of AI disruption. AI combined with mobile robots, both humanoid and other, has significant implications for the human lifestyle beyond simply displacing jobs.

We don’t know which AI will have the most significant disruption. Will it be a language model? Will it be something else?

There is only one company with a major AI lead, and that company is OpenAI. Not slowing them down could lead to a powerful monopoly over the AI industry.

And last, we don’t know what type of entity AI is. What happens if it says it can feel pain? What if it says it wants to be “free”? These are science fiction questions, that are now relevant in our lifetime."
